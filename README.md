# Class Capacity Webscraper

I created this program in one day as a result of a class I wanted to get into reaching max capacity. It directs itself to a specific page of the student website that displays class capacities and checks the current capacity. If the class is not at capacity, the program will send an email to the user through their gmail. It uses chrome Webdriver in order to run a headless browser, and stores screenshots in order to verify that it is working; it also accesses the raw html directly which is not a clean or efficient manner of doing this. However, I wasn't concerned with efficiency as I was intent on finishing this on the same day in case seats opened up. It also uses VBS scripts in order to run in the background of the system from startup to shutdown, howwever errors can occur while setting this up. I intend to revisit and revamp this code in the future.
